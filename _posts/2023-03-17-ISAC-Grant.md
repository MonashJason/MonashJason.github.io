The MTCPG Group successfully secure project funding from the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy!

Taking our research from discovery through to translation is in our blood, and we are delighted to see Drs Jinxin Zhao, Yu-Wei Lin, Nusaibah Abdul Rahim and colleagues receive funding to develop effective theraputic options against life-threatening superbugs.
All investigators will be working on "Evolution on Lung-Chip Drives Dose Optimisation of Antibiotic Combination Therapies: A Systems and Computational Approach", which will integrate evolution biology with systems pharmacology on optimising antibiotic combination!
